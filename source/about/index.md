My name is Payoj. I am a Software Engineer at Google. I love playing the guitar, writing poems, eating good food and lifting weights. This is a blog where I unfetter my mind and I compile my thoughts, experiences and some of my poems. Feel free to add me on LinkedIn or Facebook if you'd like to be in touch.
