Gopalpur is a small coastal town in the southern part of Odisha. I visited a beach resort there named Mayfair Palm Beach. It was a blissful experience spending a night under the warm skies of this beautiful fisherman town and relaxing in the soothing splashes of the awesome Bay of Bengal.

This (above) is the view you get as soon as you step into the resort. It's like the stairs at the end of this hallway are descending into the restless and infinite sea (the sea is Bay of Bengal). Odisha is one of the hottest parts of India and is also my home state. It's December, but the weather was touching 80 degrees Farenheit.

Take a minute to read that thing I am standing next to. The Mayfair resort has a long and interesting history, as you can see. Just to give you some more context, the Oberois have historically been one of the wealthiest families in India and own the very successful and upscale chain of hotels called The Oberoi.

Several famous people, mostly Indian, have set foot on this resort over the years. There was an old picture there, right next to where I was standing that said it was of the queen of England. I am not sure of her name though.

These are some of the local fishermen. The Mayfair resort may be all fancy from the inside, but right outside its secure premises and private beach lies a town rife with poverty and utter filth. I don't say this with disdain, but with deep sadness at the divide that exists in this country between the rich and the poor. I have lived outside of this country, I have met people from most nations in the world, but I can't say that I have seen the divide and distance between the haves and the have nots that I have seen in India. I have also seen more of a willingness in the rich of this country to bask in their riches in a perverted, almost feudal kind of way and a fakeness that is reminiscent of sycophants in colonial India. It's like some people have immeasurable amount of wealth and then there are millions for whom $150 a month is a luxurious salary for a 4 person family. $150 is what we spend in an evening of partying or having fun in America. It's these things that I personally keep forgetting as soon as I go back to America into my bubble of abundance. Not that there is anything wrong with enjoying when you have the resources, but I think that I should spare just a little bit of my lunch money from time to time, for someone across the world who hasn't been as lucky as I have. I sponsor a child in Africa, but everytime I see people like these I get motivation to do more, and my friends who do way more to make a difference than just donate money always continue to inspire me. The younger people of this country are now much more aware and responsible and as the world becomes a smaller place every day, the power of education, entrepreneurship and upliftment of the poor and backward becomes ever more clear. The youth of this country has stepped up to the challenge impressively and with an aware and responsible new goverment that the country now has, one that encourages entrepreneurship more than ever, this country has hope, lots of it.
