Hyderabad is a major Indian city and the capital city of the state of Telangana. It's also one of the 2 major hubs in India's Silicon Valley, the other being Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore. I visited Hyderabad on the weekend of 17th and 18th December.

No trip to Hyderabad is complete without a visit to Charminar. It's as iconic a structure in Hyderabad as is the Space Needle in Seattle, Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

I woke up early Sunday morning and took an Uber to Charminar from my hotel at around 6:30AM. It was a 23km drive in the beautiful and crisp Sunday morning sun.

The Uber driver narrated legends of all the major landmarks that we were passing on our way to Charminar. He said Charminar was built to commemorate the eradication of plague (which he pronounced "pay-goo"). All Uber drivers I met in Hyderabad spoke English and Hindi and were very friendly. Once I got to Charminar, I realized that I was a couple of hours early and the gates didn't open until 9AM. So, I handed my phone over the fence to the security guard and asked him to take a picture of the slab that explained the history of Charminar, and that's what you see in the picture below.

<span>![History of Charminar](http://d25cyoigalktuj.cloudfront.net/hyderabad/charminar_history.PNG)</span>

Hyderabad was ruled by Nizams until 1948 when it was forced to join the Indian union. Nizams were muslim monarchs who branched off from the Mughal administration. In pre-independence India, Hyderabad was one of the most prosperous and progressive princely states. As wikipedia says, and I realized from my trip, Nizams were great patrons of food, literature, poetry, music and architecture. All this is clearly reflected in the culture and food of present day Hyderabad. The Nizams are also attributed with introduction of railways, electricity, and irrigation reservoirs among other crucial infrastructural necessities in Hyderabad. As can be seen in the picture below (click to expand), the present day markets and public buildings are interspersed with Nizam era buildings, many of which serve as public offices and hospitals as well.

Nizams of Hyderabad have also historically been one of the wealthiest people on the planet because of the wealth of gold, diamonds (see the number of diamonds from India in this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diamonds). This being an [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_Diamond).), land, etc that they owned, much of which, Indians claim, was plundered away by the British before 1947. 

Hyderabad's population consists of a majority of Muslims. This portion of the demographic is primarily concentrated in what's called, the old city. This is the part of the city from old times when Hyderabad was established as a city by Quli Qutb Shah. The newer part of the city is the westernized, silicon valley area with companies like Microsoft, Google, and young people, flashy night clubs, etc. Coming back to the old city, when you drive in there, you see a number of beautiful mosques, meticulously carved minarets, and kids running around in dazzling *sherwanis*. Also, like any other old city in India it's drenched in its history and filled with people who are fiercely proud of it. The old city can also come across as a bit filthy to people visiting from abroad, but the filth and the mess is just a side effect of being an old city in India. It holds true for all old cities in the country and is hard to change, partly, as my Uber driver stated, because the mindset of people is slow to change. If you're able to look past this superficial shortcoming, then you'll be able to experience the true colors of this beautiful country.

One of the most remarkable things about the populus of India is how well people of different religions (and sometimes races) coexist here. This wasn't always the case. I remember as a child in the 90s how politicians used people's differences against them and riots frequently broke out. Hyderabad's old city was also known for communal riots and violence. Those days are behind the people of India and different communities and religions coexist in India in an amazingly graceful manner. Below is a small instance of that coexistence. A Laxmi (hindu goddess) temple in the perimeter of Charminar, an icon of Hyderabad, built by a Nizam, in a predominantly muslim neighborhood.

On my way to Charminar that morning my Uber got stuck in the car/foot traffic in a large *mutton market* in old city. This is the first time I saw such a market in India. Although, I have to be honest, I was deeply shocked by the way animals were being treated there. It was messed up. But that's a part of what I saw in my trip and I'll share it here with you.

After finishing off Charminar, I decided to visit Golkonda fort, which is another major historical landmark of Hyderabad. It was an 11km Uber ride. On my way there, as we approached the fort, we had to enter a part of Hyderabad called Golkonda through one of the 4 grand gates of Golkonda. The picture below shows the one I went in through.

<span>![A gate into Golkonda](http://d25cyoigalktuj.cloudfront.net/hyderabad/golconda_gate.jpg)</span>

The following is the entrance to the actual fort which lies at a distance of about 4-5kms from the gate.

<span>![Doors of Golkonda](http://d25cyoigalktuj.cloudfront.net/hyderabad/golconda_entrance_doors.jpg)</span>

Golkonda fort was the seat of government in the 1500s and the Qutb Shahi dynasty ruled from there. One of the Qutb Shahi's, Quli Qutb Shah, as I mentioned earlier, founded the city of Hyderabad. Golkonda fort is a magnificient granite fort with astonishing acoustic engineering. Golkonda fort is also where the famous [Koh-i-noor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-i-Noor) diamond and (according to Wikipedia) the [Hope Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Diamond) were stored at one time before being acruired or plundered, depending on how you look at it, by the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-i-Noor#Acquisition_by_the_British) and the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Diamond#Geological_beginnings) respectively. 

The picture on the left below is the ceiling of the area you land in as soon as you enter the fort. The one on the right is where the sultan/nizam actually resided way up in the hill. It's amazing how there is a small (about 2ft x 2ft) square spot below that specially designed ceiling, where if you clap it sounds like about 8 or 10 people are loudly clapping. But as soon as you step out of that square, it sounds like a normal, one person clap. A guide who was trying to coax me into paying him a ridiculous amount of money told me that the way it was designed like that was so the guards at the gate could signal with claps that could be heard all the way up the mountain. For instance, 3 claps meant there was an enemy at the door.

	400 %}
</span>

Right next to the entrance, in the fort was a mortuary bath where the corpses of sultans and queens would be cleansed before being transported for burial. The slab in the left picture below explains more. The picture on the right is a small tunnel through which the corpses were transported for burial. The reason they weren't transported from the main entrance is because the death of a monarch would usually be an open invitation for enemies to invade. The deaths were announced only after a successor had taken over.

So, the guide asked me for 600 rupees for a 30 minute tour, and that was super ridiculous, so I decided to walk the fort and explore on my own. Here are some of the pictures I took. Click on any picture and use the arrow keys to navigate.

Apart from the sightseeing, I also got to hang out with two old buddies of mine. Sri, the one in the blue shirt, has been my very close friend for more than 13 years now and we share the same philosophy about life in many respects - spirituality, literature, art, etc. Sameer has also been my friend for just as long. I used to be in a band with Sameer in college and we jammed after almost 10 years. Sameer is an amazing guy, with a very unconventional way of thinking. Both Sri and Sameer are true entrepreneurs at heart in the way they think and in the passions they pursue and work they do for a living. I could go on for hours about them, but I will keep that for another post.

In this trip, I also tried some of the wonderful Hyderabadi food. Specifically, Biryani from the famous Paradise restaurant, pastries and cookies from the famous Karachi Bakery, sweets from the amazing Makrand sweet shop and some great *meetha pan* (sweet betel). Hyderabad is also famous for *Irani Chai* (Iranian tea), but I don't drink tea, so I didn't try it. Here are some pictures.

I also went to the Google campus in Hyderabad. Below are some pics from that. I was especially impressed by how an Ambassador car was commemorated and placed as a piece of art in the second floor of Google. Ambassador was a car from the good old days in India when luxury cars hadn't really made their way into mainstream India. Considering the condition of roads that existed in those days, Ambassador was the hardiest of cars. What's more, it had the biggest seats and the largest legroom. I miss riding around in Ambassadors. With the new wave of luxury cars the Ambassador simply had no chance. But you'll be dearly missed, Ambassador.

It was a short trip, lasting less than 24 hours, and I went to Hyderabad primarily to meet old friends. After Golkonda in the morning, I had to rush back to the hotel to check out and head to the airport. But hey, all that rushing back was not for nothing. I saw Aamir Khan checking out at the hotel at the same time as I did. That was random :)

Here are some more pictures from my trip.
